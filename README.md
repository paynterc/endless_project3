## Endless Runner Tutorial
This is a completed version of the Endless Runner tutorial found in Project2. You can add your own sounds and animations to this game by changing the file names
found in the "create" function of stateMain.js.

## Tools

Make graphics with Piskel: https://www.piskelapp.com

Make sound effects with BFXR: https://www.bfxr.net

Make music with Beepbox: https://www.beepbox.co

## Tips

Export your graphics as .png files and place them in the images/main directory.

Sound effects should be .wav files. Put them in the audio/sfx directory.

Music can be .wav or .mp3. Place it in the audio/background directory.

You can see how I made the Beepbox music at this url:
